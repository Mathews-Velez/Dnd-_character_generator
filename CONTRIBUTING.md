# Contributing

DND is a huge project. It's way too much work for one person do do all alone. Thanks for choosing to help out!

Before you submit your work, please be sure to check out the [templates](./.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/). It helps the project maintainers quickly review your ideas which means they'll be implemented even faster!

# Cleanliness

Because of the shear volume of text required for the project, many files are generated. Please try your best to keep the root directory clean. Group your files into separate folders based on their function.
